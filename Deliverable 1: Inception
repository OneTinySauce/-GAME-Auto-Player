Junjian's first interview
Junjian:Hello! I am doing a project that can autoplay games, did you hve time for an interview? won't take long.
Brittany:uh ok?
Junjian:Have you play the Clash of Clans before?
Brittany:no
Junjian:How about any games on the phone?
Brittany:ya but i get bored of themn
Junjian:Is this because those games have too much repetitive operation to play? like you have to farming a lot on a same map?
Brittany:i guess? Different maps and such and the story "progresses". it just gets repetitive and not worth while
Junjian:Well, I am totally understand. What if there is a program to help you to farm and play repetitive steps in the game, will you use that program for support?
Before that I would probably uninstall it since at that point its just one single function
Junjian:Could you tell me more about what the function is ?
Brittany:if the function was just to get the repetitiveness out of it then it shows me that the game itself is just repetitiveness and has no actual content so I would uninstall it
Junjian:Did you think many people willing to have the autoplay program?
Brittany:i know that I have run into some desperate people who no life those so yes
Junjian:From your view, that program can help you separate with games having content or not, so did you think this program will help game industry improve a little bit?
Brittany:nope. with that kind of program out there, it may cause a problem because no one would bother logging on since its already being done for them. Developers may see that they need to get rid of the repetitiveness but at the same time there's always someone who is desperate in those games
Junjian:Could you talk about what the problem would exactly be?
Brittany:problem as in the game does not get played a lot,, I know the gaming industry gets money for the hours people are on their phone playing the developers game
Junjian:Do you think the autolplay can force companies to make games that have more content, so we will have more good games in market?
Brittany:Nope there will always be a group of people that will always play those games and the developers would just try to turn everything to them
Junjian:I see that's  is a very good point. Thanks for your time miss !

Second
Junjian:Hello! I am doing a project that can autoplay games, did you hve time for an interview? won't take long.
Miss:Yes,  I guess.
Junjian:Have you play the Clash of Clans before?
Miss:nope, I don't play video games
Junjian:Have you seeing your friend palying phone games or you don't play but knowing the phone games?
Miss:Yeah,, my son and dougther play a lot
Junjian:If there is a software that can play the game automaticlly, did you think you will let your son to use it?
Miss:If that can reduce the time they spend on the phone, I am glad to have one.
Junjian:Yes, the autoplayer is helps palyer to reduce thier repetitive operations, like if it's time to collet coins on phone the software will help them to do it.
Miss:It does sounds like they don't have to check the phone very frequently but will it make them more stick on their phone game?
Junjian:That's a good point! our taget users are gamer but we may considering to have a version which do everthing for the gamer and make game much boring, so the player may no longer play the game. I think this would be help for people like you.
Miss: Yeah, that's sounds suit for me
