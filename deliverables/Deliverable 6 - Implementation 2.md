**Group members:** Teng Ao, Miles Brown, Ran Li, Devin O'Neal, Ulugbgek Abdullayev, and Junjian Yin

## 1. Introduction
  In our previous release, we have implemented resource collection feature which was requested as per MVP. Since Clash of Clans is highly object related game, we have had to implement building upgrade queue for our new realse. Now, as a clash of clans player, you can automate building upgrade queue and our program will assign available workers to the essencail buildings that need upgrading.
  
  We have also upgdated a new version of user interface that is bug-free and includes building automation choice at the start of the program. Once the user opts for the building upgrade automation, our product will lounch the emulator and the clash of clans game as well. There are new features like Town Hall upgrade and Gold Storage upgrade and our product will choose which building to upgrade depending on the availability of resources and workers.
